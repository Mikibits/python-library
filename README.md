# python-library

Reusable Python utility classes, functions, and class wrappers I created while redesigning my Cardz app from Java to Python.

## Description

Reusable Python utility classes, functions, and class wrappers I created while building a grid-based GUI organizer application for writers. This is a ground-up rebuilding of that Java program, since Python has a fundamentally different (and faster) way of doing things. It was worth the effort.

Most of these utility classes and functions came from redeveloping my Cardz application, an infinite scrolling desktop of draggable index cards, for organizing notes and ideas for writers. The majority of the code that makes up that application resides in this library, since I designed as much of it as possible to be reusable in other grid-based applications--everything from grid menus and launchers to card games.

This collection also includes classes that help simplify commonly used frameworks and practices, such as:

 - Easily creating and updating config files
 - A double linked list
 - A two-dimensional double linked list (lists of columns/rows of other lists)
 - Persistence classes for 1- and 2-dimensional double linked lists
 - A simplified SQLite database API
 - Several common-use dialogs, such as opening a recent project at startup
 - Class wrappers to fix weird (nonintuitive) methods in Python's own libraries
 - Various functions to simplify common functionality to simplify code
 - And others

## Get in Touch

I welcome comments and ideas for making these more useful and elegant, as well as suggestions to better document them.

Also, I am open for work in Python, Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C++, or just about any other language (I pick them up pretty quickly).
