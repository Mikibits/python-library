# Notes:
#   - This is as much an integration test as a set of unit tests:
#       - Each test is designed to test only that method comprehensively, but...
#       - Each test relies on preceding tests to create a complex enough data context
#         to fully test the following methods.
#       - This is the reason for the X index (test_X_methodname), in case unittest
#         wants to run the tests alphabetically.
